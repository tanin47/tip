Tip: Universal tooltip for Mac OS X
===================================================

[![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/tanin-tip/community#)

Tip provides useful info at your fingertip. You can simply select the text and hit the shortkey to activate the tooltip showing useful info.

"Useful info" is programmed by you using your fav programming language, and it works with every Mac app.

Examples
---------

### Convert the seconds from epoch to the human-readable time and copy it to clipboard

### Open a JIRA ticket on the selected text

You can make your own info provider. The possibility is endless!

Usage
------

1. Select the text
2. Hit the configured short key
3. The tooltip with relevant info will show
4. Use arrow keys to choose an item in the tooltip and hit 'Enter' to perform the appropriate action. Alternatively, you can click an item as well

Currently, Tip supports 2 actions: (1) Copy to clipboard if the item is text, and (2) Open URL if the item is URL.


Installation
-------------

1. Download the latest version of `Tip.app` from [the release page](https://github.com/tanin47/tip/releases)
2. Download and copy `scripts/provider` to `~/.tip/provider`. Run `chmod 755 ~/.tip/provider`
3. Go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services and set the short key for "Tip: open tips". (I set my touch bar to always show function keys and use Cmd + F3)

If [your short key doesn't include the Command key](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/260683/keyboard-shortcut-for-service-only-works-after-i-manually-run-the-service), you will need to activate it manually by:

1. Selecting a text
2. Clicking on the application menu > Services > "Tip: open tips"

Now you'll be able to use the short key for Tip.


Technical detail
-----------------

Tip is a [system-wide service on Mac](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/extensions/services/). When user selects text and hits the short key, the selected text is sent to Tip. Then, Tip invokes the command-line tool with the selected text as the first argument, i.e `~/.tip/provider [selected-text]`.

The command-line tool processes the input, decides which info to show, and prints the tip items as JSON that looks like below:

```
[
  {"type": "text", "value": "Some text"},
  {"type": "url", "label": "Go to JIRA", "value": "https://your-jira-url/JIRA-0001"},
]
```

Tip processes the JSON and renders the tooltip at the mouse location.


Develop a provider
-------------------

1. Make an executable binary at `~/.tip/provder` and `chmod 755 ~/.tip/provider`.
2. Test the provider manually first by executing `~/.tip/provider [some-input]` to see if it returns a valid JSON.

The JSON must be an array that looks like below:

```
[
  {"type": "text", "value": "Some text"},
  {"type": "url", "label": "Go to JIRA", "value": "https://your-jira-url/JIRA-0001"},
]
```

For text, it must contains `"type": "text"` and the field `value`.

For URL, it must contains `"type": "url"` and the fields `label` and `value`.

If the tooltip doesn't work correctly, please see log messages in Console.app.

Happy programming!
